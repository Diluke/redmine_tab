== INSTALLATION == 

To install from git: 

$ cd {RAILS_ROOT}/vendor/plugins
$ git clone git://github.com/jamtur01/redmine_tab.git

== INSTRUCTIONS ==

This creates a single tab in which you can embed an iframe. You can globally configure the name of the tab in the Plugins -> Tab Plugin configuration options (default is "Tab Name"). The iframe-links can be configured on a per-project base using the value of a pre-configured project custom field.

1. You need to go to 'Admin -> Custom fields -> Project' and create a field of the type 'Long text' to hold the iframe-link.
2. Select the field you've created in the plugin configuration by selecting Plugins -> Tab Plugin and clicking Configure.
3. Inside your project you will need to add your iframe-link as the value of the field you've selected. For example to embed Google: <iframe src="http://www.google.com/" style="border: 0" width="800" height="600" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
4. Then use the project's Modules tab to enable the Tab module for the project.
